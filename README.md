# IntelliGit

Highly opinionated and experimental console application for smarter Git commits

## About and Why?

I'm developing this app for myself, to make the specific Git operations I personally often make be faster and more efficient. It might be useful for you, but it probably will not. It's very opinionated and will not replace a traditional Git interface. But it's open source because it's me and I love open source.

## Installation

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/caendesilva/IntelliGit/releases/latest/download/igit -o igit
chmod +x igit && sudo mv igit /usr/local/bin/igit
```
